# 🔍 Scene Sense AI  
### AI-Powered Computer Vision & Contextual Scene Understanding System

VisionSense AI is an intelligent computer vision application that combines **YOLOv8 object detection** with **Google Gemini Generative AI** to analyze images and generate meaningful, professional scene descriptions. The application detects objects present in an image and uses GenAI to infer the broader context of the scene.
